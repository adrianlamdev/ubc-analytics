# UBC Metrics

An experimental project exploring course data analytics and machine learning at the University of British Columbia (UBC). This project uses historical grade distributions to provide grade predictions, identify GPA boosters, and offer data-driven insights into UBC campus activity.

**Important:** All predictions should be considered estimates only. This tool is designed for educational purposes and should not be the sole factor in your academic decisions. We are not officially affiliated with UBC.

## Project Components

This project is divided into three main components:

- **[Data Analysis](data-analysis/README.md):** Jupyter notebooks and scripts used for data analysis, model training, and experimentation.
- **[Backend](backend/README.md):** A FastAPI backend providing an API for accessing the trained models and data.
- **[App](app/README.md):** A Next.js web app providing a user interface for interacting with the API.
