For grade predictions, our model explains about 52% of grade variance (RÂ² score), with a root mean square error of 5.02 and mean absolute percentage error of 4.84%. Campus activity predictions are sourced directly from Google Maps data. We're transparent about our model's performance and continuously work to improve it.",
